# Medicine Clash Refactoring Kata 

Your new job is working at a health insurance company, on their system for alerting doctors about potential medicine clashes. Your first task is to fix a bug in some existing code. Since you have a lot of experience already with the tools and language being used, your new colleagues have left you to your own devices. You have quickly reviewed the code and noted the high test coverage, small methods, and descriptive method names. Someone else has even already written a new unit test to expose the bug. In short, you expect this task to be straightforward.

Do any refactoring you need in order to understand the code and fix the bug. When you have done this, review the starting code again. Did the high test coverage, small methods and descriptive method names mean this code was easy to work with?

# How to get the code and tests running

To run the tests for the Ruby version, you will need to install these gems:

- rspec
- mocha

To run the tests for the Python version, you will need to install [mockito](http://code.google.com/p/mockito-python/).
